## Grades

This course will consist of 35% lab assignments (5 lab assignments, 7% each), 20% quizzes (5 quizzes, 4% each), 15% midterm and 30% final exam.
Please see "Calendar" for the release and due dates for labs, dates for quizzes, the midterm and the final exam.
The quizzes will take place at the beginning of lectures, and the midterm and final will take the duration of the entire lecture and will be hosted in the classroom. 

## Getting help

If you have questions about the lab assignments, including questions on how to set up, compile, implement, debug the lab, please ask them on Piazza and/or attend the TA's office hour.

## Cheating

You should work independently on the lab assignments. You can discuss with fellow students but your work should be your own.

## Late Assignments

You will be given 5 day ``late credits'' for all assignments. Once the late credits are used up, late assignments will not be accepted unless for extremely exceptional circumstances.
