## About

Hi. Welcome to CS5600 Spring 2026!

## Grades

This course will consist of 35% lab assignments, 20% quizzes, 15% midterm and 30% final exam.

## Cheating

You should work independently on the lab assignments. You can discuss with fellow students but your work should be your own.

## Late Assignments

You will be given 5 day ``late credits'' for all assignments. Once the late credits are used up, late assignments will not be accepted unless for extremely exceptional circumstances.
